# Julia_Fractals

A window application written in C++ that allows generating fractals from the Julia set and saving them as a bitmap. The program uses two DLLs written in two different languages (C++ and ASM) to compare the execution times of the same task depending on the language.

Requires Microsoft Macro Assembler in order to work (https://www.masm32.com/)
